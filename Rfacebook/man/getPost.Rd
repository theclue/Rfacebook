\description{
\code{getPost} retrieves information about a public Facebook post, including
list of comments and likes.
}
\details{
\code{getPost} is a convenient wrapper for \code{\link{getPosts}} intented to be
100% compatibile with the original Rfacebook function of the same name.
It is deprecated and it will drop sometime sooner or later.
\code{getPost} returns a list with three components: \code{post},
\code{likes}, and \code{comments}. First, \code{post} contains information
about the post: author, creation date, id, counts of likes, comments, and
shares, etc. Second, \code{likes} is a data frame that contains names and
Facebook IDs of all the users that liked the post. Finally, \code{comments}
is a data frame with information about the comments to the post (author,
message, creation time, id).
