\title{Class for representing a Collection of Facebook likes}
\description{
Connect to Facebook Graph API, get likes from a list of public Facebook posts or comments and build a \code{\link{FacebookLikesCollection-class}}
instance.

Use the \code{\link{FacebookLikesCollection}} constructor for building a instance of this class, as it provides better
sanity and validation checks.
}
\details{
Although they are named the same in the Facebook jargon, posts/comments likes and users'likes are different entities.
This collection covers the first, while \code{\link{FacebookUsersLikesCollection-class}} the latter.
